Adjacency Matrix:
It is the 2D matrix that is used to map the association between the graph nodes. 
If a graph has n number of vertices, then the adjacency matrix of that graph is n x n, and each entry of the matrix represents the number of edges from one vertex to another.

Adjacency List:
An adjacency list is a data structure used to represent a graph where each node in the graph stores a list of its neighboring vertices.
