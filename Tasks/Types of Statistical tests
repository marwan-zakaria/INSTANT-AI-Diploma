T-Test:

Example: A t-test can be used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the mean scores of two groups. 
For instance, it could be used to compare the mean exam scores of students who received tutoring versus those who did not.

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):

Example: ANOVA can be employed to test for differences in means among three or more groups. 
For example, it could be used to compare the average income levels of individuals across different education levels (e.g., high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree).

Chi-Square Test:

Example: Chi-square tests are often used to examine the association between categorical variables. 
For instance, it could be used to determine whether there is a significant relationship between gender (male/female) and voting preference (Republican/Democrat/Independent).

Correlation Analysis:

Example: Correlation analysis is used to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two continuous variables. 
For example, it could be employed to assess the correlation between hours of study and exam scores among a group of students.

Regression Analysis:

Example: Regression analysis is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 
For instance, it could be used to predict the sales of a product based on advertising expenditure, competitor prices, and other factors.

Mann-Whitney U Test:

Example: This non-parametric test compares the distributions of two independent samples to determine if they are drawn from the same population. 
It could be used to assess whether there is a difference in the median scores of two groups when the assumptions of the t-test are not met.

Kruskal-Wallis Test:

Example: Similar to the Mann-Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA and compares the distributions of three or more independent samples. 
For example, it could be used to compare the median scores of three different teaching methods.

Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test:

Example: This non-parametric test compares paired samples to determine if their population means ranks differ. 
It could be used to evaluate whether there is a significant difference in pre- and post-test scores for individuals who underwent a training program.
